# You're going to build an app now!
# You want to be able to send secret messages to your best friend
# without your pesky little sister being able to read them. So you
# decide on a Caesar Cipher, for every alphabetic character, you
# will exchange it with a character three larger, wrapping around:
#   "a" => "d"
#   "z" => "c"
#   "A" => "D"
#   "B" => "E"
#   "0" => "3"
#   "9" => "2"
# 
# But your best friend is kind of a numbskull, he keeps messing
# it up. So you decide to write a web application to encrypt
# the message for him.
# 
# When he goes to yourapp.com/encrypt, he will be presented
# with a form that he can type his message into. When he
# posts it to yourapp.com/encrypted, he will be presented
# with the encrypted message.
# 
# When he goes to yourapp.com/decrypt, he will be presented
# with a form that he can type the encrypted message into.
# When he posts it to yourapp.com/decrypted, he will be
# presented with the decrypted message.
