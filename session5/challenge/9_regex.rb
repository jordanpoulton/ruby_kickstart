# This challenge requires that you've completed challenges 7 and 8

# The Green Thumb Nursery calls you up "hey, remember that list of trees we sent you?"
# "Sure" you reply, fondly reveling in the brillinace of your regular expression that
# parsed it. "We want you to put it in a webpage for us" they tell you.
# 
# Given the same inputs as challenge 7, output results in string format like this:
#   <!doctype html>
#   <html>
#     <head>
#       <title>Green Thumb Nursery</title>
#     </head>
#     <body>
#       <h1>Catalog</h1>
#       <table>
#         <tr>
#           <th>Type of tree</th>
#           <th>Size of the tree</th>
#           <th>Price of the tree</th>
#         </tr>
#         
#         <!-- Put records here -->
#         <tr>
#           <td>American Redbud Tree</td>
#           <td>1 to 2 feet</td>
#           <td>$5.95</td>
#         </tr>
#         <!-- etc -->
#       </table>
#     </body>
